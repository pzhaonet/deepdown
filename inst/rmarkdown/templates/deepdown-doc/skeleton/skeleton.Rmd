This is a demonstration for the R package **deepdown** package, which allows you another way of using R **markdown** with some interesting features. 

With deepdown, you can integrate R codes and their outputs with ASCII diagrams, calendars, equations, and other features in plain text documents. Besides R, **deepdown** and **knitr**, you don't have to install anything else. The output file can be viewed by any web browser.

# Quick start

## Installation

1. Install R.
2. Install RStudio IDE.
3. Install **deepdown**:


~~~~~~~~ r linenumbers
remotes::install_github("pzhaonet/deepdown")
~~~~~~~~

## Create a demo file

`R Studio` ==> `New File` ==> `R Markdown` ==> `From Template` ==> `deepdown`.

## Get a product

Don't click the `knit` button for a deepdown output! A deepdown file works in a different way from a traditional R markdown file.

Save the demo file as, for example, `dd.Rmd`, and run:

~~~~~~~~ r linenumbers
deepdown::deepdown("dd.Rmd")
~~~~~~~~

You will see the output in your web browser.

## Major Features

It supports basic syntax of R markdown. The major differences and extended features are as follows:

- Videos and audios easily embedded.
- ASCII diagrams.
- Built-in mini calendars.
- Task lists.
- Built-in notices.
- Easy cross references of tables, images, listings, and equations.
- Citations and references.
- Paragraph numbers and code line numbers.
- Multi columns for the texts.

# Basic syntax

## Markdown syntax

R **deepdown** inherits all the fundamental syntax of R markdown.

| You type                          | You get                                                      |
| --- | --- |
| `*italic*`                        | *italic*                                                     |
| `**bold**`                        | **bold**                                                     |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |
| <code>`inline code`</code> | `inline code` |
| `$E = mc^2$`                      | equations: $E = mc^2$ |
| `[link](https://...)`             | [link](https://xjtlu.edu.cn)                       |
| `![](image)`                      | insert an image                                              |
| `# Chapter 1`                     | headings                                                     |
| `1. list...`                      | numbered list                                                |
| `- list...`                       | unnumbered list                                              |

It also supports the block syntax, such as <code>```</code> for code locks, and  `>` for quotes. R markdown uses will feel easy about this.

## R Markdown support

The core feature of R Markdown, i.e. embedding codes and the output into the document, is inherited. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## New syntax

| You type              | You get   |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| `- [x] task1` | task list |
| `5 kg/m^3`                               | 5 kg/m^3 |
| `5 degrees`                              | 5 degrees |
| `x<sub>below</sub>`                      | x<sub>below</sub> |
| `<-> <==> -> --> <- <-- ==> <==` | <-> <==> -> --> <- <-- ==> <== |
| `2 x 3` | 2 x 3 |
| `<small>text or image</small>`  | small text or image            |
| `<big>text or image</big>`       | big text or image |
| `<center>text</center>` | center text |




# Elements

## Videos

Videos can be embedded in the same way as an image.

Embed a video with the file URL like `![Caption](URL)`:

![HES](http://play.xjtlu.edu.cn/sv/54f8b7fc-17195d88845/54f8b7fc-17195d88845.mp4)

or a Youtube link:

![Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjcxPd6Oag8&list=FLs76tyulNUTPSzagsuTA8UA&index=1&t=165s&ab_channel=StanChang)

or a Vimeo link:

![Figure [fig:boy]: The Boy with a Camera For a Face](https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/151493973)

## Audios

Audios can be embedded in the same way as an image.

Embed a video with the file URL:

![A Song](https://gallery.pzhao.org/audio/深情相拥.m4a)

## Images

### Side images

![<small>"Figure [fig:cornell]: [Tiny Planet Clouds](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldyXRw)" by Valentin Galea</small>](https://www.cs.williams.edu/~morgan/cs371-f16/image/world.jpg width="30%" border=2)
Insert a side image with `![Caption](URL width="30%" border=2)`.

Multiple images in one row with `![Caption](URL height=140px border=1)`:

![Figure [spheres]: Perfect spheres and triangles](http://graphicscodex.com/projects/rays/spheres.jpg height=140px border=1) ![Figure [sponza]: Sponza with direct illumination](http://graphicscodex.com/projects/rays/sponza.jpg height=140px border=1) ![Figure [teapot]: Complex indirect lighting](http://graphicscodex.com/projects/rays/teapot.jpg height=140px border=1)

### Reference images

![<small>"[Tiny Planet Clouds](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldyXRw)" by Valentin Galea</small>][refimage]

[refimage]: https://www.cs.williams.edu/~morgan/cs371-f16/image/world.jpg width="30%" border="2"

### Cross reference

Use `Figure [label]` in an image caption and cross refer it as `Figure [label]`. For example, see Figure [spheres].

### Directly download

Give a downloading link as `[](URL download)` like: [this link will directly download](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/robot.jpg download).

## ASCII diagrams

ASCII diagrams are rendered into graphs. You can draw flowcharts, Gannt charts, Tree charts ... with only a text editor. The texts in such charts can be copied directly.

You can inverse the color of the charts:

<div class="inverse">
 ****************************************************
 *  .---.              .         .----o----.        *
 *  |    |             |         |    |    |        *
 *  |    |  --.   |.-- |   |     *----*<---+        *
 *  |    |  .-.|  |    +--+      |    |____|        *
 *  |    | |   |  |    |   |     |    |    |        *
 *  '---'   '-''  '    '   '     o----o--->'        *
 ****************************************************
</div>

Tools are recommended for drawing ASCII diagrams:

- Online: http://asciiflow.com/
- Online: https://doersino.github.io/markdeep-diagram-drafting-board/
- Offline: http://www.torchsoft.com/en/aas_information.html
- Notepad++

An R function `add_frame()`is provided by **deepdown**.

## Notices

You can add five types of notices like this:

```
!!!
    I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

    This is still more error text.

!!! note
    Another note.

!!! Tip
    Close the door on the way out.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

!!! ERROR: Seriously
    Watch out, something **bad** could happen.

    This is still more error text.
```

They generates notices:

!!!
    I'm a note. Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here.

    This is still more error text.

!!! note
    Another note.

!!! Tip
    Close the door on the way out.

!!! WARNING
    I'm a warning, perhaps. *Something might happen!*

!!! ERROR: Seriously
    Watch out, something **bad** could happen.

    This is still more error text.

## Calendars

Starting with a date, you will get a mini calendar if you make a schedule long enough. The following texts:

```
2020-10-01: .

2020-10-30: .

2020-11-01: .

2020-12-2: .

```

generates a (almost) blank calendar:

2020-10-01: .

2020-10-30: .

2020-11-01: .

2020-12-2: .



You can fill the calendar with events:

Tuesday Feb 16, 2016: Project Launch

 - Create specifications
 - Initialize revision control system

Friday Feb 19, 2016: Build Milestone

 - Build system fully functional
 - Placeholder unit tests committed

 _Plan for weekend overtime if we miss this milestone_

Wednesday Feb 24, 2016: Site Visit
 **Whole team vistits client**. Dress appropriately.

Friday Feb 26, 2016: Demo Milestone

 - Internal demonstrations for management
 - QA reports due

(Monday Feb 29, 2016): Office Closed

Tuesday Mar 1, 2016: Code Freeze

 - Commit final features before this date
 - Only priority 1 fixes with issue tracking numbers
   after this point

Monday Mar 7, 2016: Beta

Wednesday Mar 16, 2016: Gold

The leading dates can be in any unambiguous format that includes a month, day, and
four-digit year between 1000 and 2999, such as:

- 2001-03-01
- 1 Apr. 1999
- 4-07-1976
- February 16, 2016
- 2020 Jan. 15
- May 15th, 1982

## Definition Lists

By default, definition lists are displayed tightly:

Grapes
: Available in purple ("red") and green ("white") varieties.

Bananas
: Only yellow.

If you need more space, give the first definition multiple lines

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in  the family Rosaceae.

    Multiple paragraphs are supported.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

    - Can also
    - Put lists
    - In definitions

## Equations	

Besides the `$equation$` and `$$equation$$` syntax, **deepdown** supports the latex equation environment, and cross reference. The syntax is:

```latex
\begin{equation}
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
\label{myeq}
\end{equation}

See Eqn. [myeq]
```

## Embed files

<center>`(insert otherdocument.md.html here)`</center>

<center>`(embed example.py here)`</center>

Advanced Applications*The following features are experimental and may change at any time. See the* *[release history](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/#history) for change information between versions.*

## TOC (Table of contents)

In the YAML header of the deepdown file, you could set the layout style for the TOC (`tocStyle`). Values are:

- `auto`: Adjust based on the length of the document. (Default)
- `none`: Do not show a TOC.
- `short`: Show a short table of level-1 headers on a line across the top of the document.
- `medium`: Float a small-font full table of contents to the right of the abstract.
- `long`: Insert a full table of contents in normal font size as the first section after the abstract.

# Formats

## Smart quotes

Smart quotes mean that blockquotes formatted in the style of an actual quotation receive special treatment for fancy quoting like:

> "You want to make it seem alive and effortless and fun, but that's an art that took me 25 years to really learn. I wanted to do it very much 25 years ago, but I didn't know how."
> 
>   -- David O. Russell, director of American Hustle

Double ASCII quotation marks are converted to proper Unicode quotation marks by detecting which side of a word they are on.

You can switch this feature on/off in the YAML `smartQuotes`.

## Line Numbers of code blocks

Line numbers of code blocks can be displayed if you use `linenumbers ` after the language name, such as `R linenumbers`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ R linenumbers
data(cars)
plot(cars)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Inline code language

The inline code can be syntax highlighted if you set `inlineCodeLang` in the YAML. It does not affect fenced code blocks.

A specific span can be forced to a language by using the HTML syntax, e.g., `<code lang=Python>...</code>`. 

```
bash cs C# cpp C++ css coffeescript html XML http JSON java JavaScript Makefile` `markdown objectivec Objective-C PHP perl python ruby shell armasm glsl go haskell` `kotlin lisp lua matlab R rust scheme swift tex typescript yaml PyxlScript none
```

## Unnumbered sections

(##) Unnumbered H2

## Paragraph Numbering

You can set the YAML  `paragraph_number` so as to display paragraph numbers.

## Unicode (in UTF-8 encoding)

You could directly use unicode characters, such as Asian characters and punctuation, Greek letters and maths. Here is a frequently used list:

- Matching pairs «»‹›“”‘’〖〗【】「」『』〈〉《》〔〕
- Greek ΑΒΓΔ ΕΖΗΘ ΙΚΛΜ ΝΞΟΠ ΡΣΤΥ ΦΧΨΩ αβγδ εζηθ ικλμ νξοπ ρςτυ φχψω

## URL Arguments

You can add `export` or `noformat` to any **deepdown** document URL to alter how it is displayed, i.e. `URL?export`, `URL?noformat`. For example, `http://foo.bar/index.html?export` shows the HTML output.

`noformat` displays the original source of the document. Due to web browser limitations, in some cases this will not be 100% accurate to the actual file source.

`export` makes the displayed body HTML source code produced by Markdeep. This is useful for exporting a Markdeep document to HTML if you need to paste it into some context, such as an ePub book or Blog site, that does not allow scripts.



## Multi-columns

The following fence can format the texts within it into two columns:

```
<div style="columns:2;-webkit-columns:2;-moz-columns:2;column-gap:3em;-webkit-column-gap:3em;-moz-column-gap:3em">
texts
</div>
```

<div style="columns:2;-webkit-columns:2;-moz-columns:2;column-gap:3em;-webkit-column-gap:3em;-moz-column-gap:3em">
You can use the CSS
[columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts)
style to make an HTML multicolumn block. Then, just use regular Markdeep within it and the
browser will automatically apply your multicolumn layout. 
Browsers are even smart enough to break the columns correctly when
printing to PDF or to a printer. However, for a long document,
multiple columns don't work well when displayed on screen. That's
because there are no discrete "pages" on screen to break columns. So,
the browser will make each column as long as the entire document,
which is probably not what you want.
So, multi-column only works well if you know that you have very short
sections (as in this example), or if you were planning on printing to
separate pages when done.
</div>

## Page Breaks

To support other markdown conventions, `\pagebreak` and `\newpage` will insert a page break in a document when printed or converted to PDF. You can also use a pattern of a series of five `+` signs on their own line, which will form a horizontal rule on screen and a new page when printed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To make top-level section headers also force page breaks, add the following to your
document or CSS file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<style>.md h1, .md .nonumberh1 {page-break-before:always}</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## CSS

Markdeep uses CSS for styling. That means you can embed a style sheet
to override anything that you don't like about the built-in styling.
For example, if you don't want section numbering, just use:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<style>h1:before, h2:before { content: none; }</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markdeep uses Markdown's syntax, even where I disagree with the
choices.  But you aren't stuck with that. Do you wish that Markdown
had specified single-asterisk for `*bold*`? You can have
that:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<style>em.asterisk { font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; }</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the list bullets (`+`, `-`, `*`) has its own CSS class. You
can use this, for example, to make `+` entries bold and `-` ones
use a circle:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<style>
  li.plus { font-weight: bold; } 
  li.minus { list-style-type: circle;}
</style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Options

Markdeep looks in the `window.markdeepOptions` object to determine its behavior. The legal options are:

- `mode`

  A String that can be:`'markdeep'` - the default: process the document as Markdeep`'script'` - do not modify the document`'html'` - process the document as HTML with embedded Markdeep nodes`'doxygen'` - process special tags in Doxygen documentation

- `lang`

  An Object describing the natural language to use for keywords such as Section and Figure. (If your language is already supported by Markdeep, it is much easier to set this via a `<meta lang="...">` tag in the document.) Look at the value of the global variable `FRENCH` in the source code to see the structure of this Object.

- `tocStyle`

  A String specifying the layout style for the table of contents. Values are:`'auto'` - Adjust based on the length of the document. (Default)`'none'` - Do not show a table of contents`'short'` - Show a short table of level-1 headers on a line across the top of the document`'medium'` - Float a small-font full table of contents to the right of the abstract`'long'` - Insert a full table of contents in normal font size as the first section after the abstract

- `scrollThreshold`

  A Number specifying the distance in pixels that the body can be scrolled before the `scrolled` class should be added to the `body` element. This is useful for creating CSS styles for web page headers that present differently when the document is first shown versus scrolled down to the contents. The default is 80.

- `definitionStyle`

  A String specifying the layout style for definition lists. Values are:`'auto'` - Adjust based on the longest definition in each list. (Default)`'short'` - Always format as a table, where definitions are in a column on the left.`'long'` - Always format using a hanging indent, where the definitions are under the terms.

- `hideEmptyWeekends`

  A Boolean specifying whether the calendar views from schedule lists should remove weekend days if there are no events on them. The default is `true`.

- `detectMath`

  A Boolean that defaults to `true`. If true, when LaTeX math surrounded by `$...$`, `\(...\)`, or `\begin{...}...\end{...}` is encountered, the MathJax processor is automatically loaded from their CDN. Set to `false` if you don't use math notation, host MathJax locally and include it using a script tag yourself, or use an alternative math processor.

- `showLabels`

  A Boolean that defaults to `false`. Display all labels for Figures, Listings, and Tables, as well as URLs for images with captions, the document itself, and links. This is useful when printing proofs of book chapters.

- `sortScheduleLists`

  A Boolean that defaults to `true`. Sort schedules in order of increasing date, regardless of the order in which events appear in the source document.

- `captionAbove`

  A table mapping `diagram`, `image`, `listing`, and `table` to Booleans. Each defaults to `false`, meaning that captions appear below (after) the objects. Set values to true to move the captions above (before) the objects. Example: `markdeepOptions.captionAbove.listing = true`. In the Markdeep source document, captions must always appear *after* the object. This option only affects where they appear when the document is viewed.

- `onLoad`

  Function invoked after Markdeep is done processing the document and the DOM is ready.

- `linkAPIDefinitions`

  Boolean that defaults to `false`. If true, inline code referencing a `variable` or `function()` is linked to a definition list that also uses inline code formatting for that `variable` or `function(args...)`. There must be no space between a function name and the opening paren. Names must be fully qualified.

- `inlineCodeLang`

  String name of a supported syntax highlighting language, such as `'Python'` or `'C++'`. If set, ``inline code`` set off in back-ticks is be syntax highlighted using that language. A specific span can be forced to a language by using the HTML syntax, e.g., `<code lang=Python>...</code>`. Does not affect fenced code blocks.

- `smartQuotes`

  Boolean that defaults to `true`. If true, double ASCII quotation marks are converted to proper Unicode quotation marks by detecting which side of a word they are on.
